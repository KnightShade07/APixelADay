To link to pages that do not have a controller associated with them, you can use asp-area and asp-page!

Example:

<a class="btn btn-secondary" asp-area="Identity" asp-page="/Account/Register">Get Started!</a>

Note: When using asp-area, be sure to include "/" (without the quotes) in order to drill down and navigate to the correct page.
