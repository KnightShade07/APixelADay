If you're looking for how to hide elements on a Razor Page from the user because they don't need to see them, here's how!:

<dt class = "col-sm-2">
            @Html.HiddenFor(model => model.PixelArtID)
        </dt>

You simply use the @Html.HiddenFor function.

And, for pages with input, you use:

<input type="hidden">, just before <asp-for="">
