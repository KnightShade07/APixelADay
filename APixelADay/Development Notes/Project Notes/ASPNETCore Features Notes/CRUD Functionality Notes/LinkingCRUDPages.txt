 6. PROPERLY WIRING NEWLY CREATED PAGES
**************************

Congrats, you've just created your first CRUD Page!!! Give yourself a pat on the back!

There's just one tiny, teensy problem, it may not be linked correctly since CRUD Pages have defaults that may need to be changed.

To do this, you need to:

1. Go to your Controller assigned to the website, in my case it would be "GalleryController".
2. Create a function for it.
3. Have it return a view, with no parameter for now.
This (the parameter) can be changed later at any time, so don't worry!

EX: 

public IActionResult Add()
        {
           return View();
        }

In the created View code itself:

1. Make sure that the button that goes back to the previous page is linked correctly,
The default will look something like this:

<a asp-action="Index">Back to List</a>

 2. Change what's inside the "" after asp-action to whatever you titled the view
 3. (Optional) If your website is not list based, you may also need to change the
 "Back to List" text to better reflect what your website does to the user.
 Ex: (You want to change the text from "Back to List" to something like "Back to Home Page").

 4. You should now be redirected to whatever page you set the asp-actions parameter to.
