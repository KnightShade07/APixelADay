 5. CREATING AUTO GENERATED CRUD PAGES ("Views")
**************************

CRUD stands for "Create,Edit/Update, Delete", and it's how you design website pages to add data functionality.

In order to add CRUD Pages, you will need to:

1. Go to your folder where you want to create the pages, typically people put it in Views.
2. Right Click on the folder, select "Add".
3. Select "View", and click "Add".
4. Depending on your situation and context, you will either want an Empty Razor Page or a regular Razor Page.
5. Select your Template Type from the dropdown list.
6. Select the class your CRUD Page/View will be working with.
7. You may or may not need a Data Context Class, depending on the situation. If you don't, then skip this step.
8. DO NOT FORGET to give your View a name!!!! You can rename it with a right click, but its better to get it right the first time!
9. Click Add, and then you've just created a CRUD Page!
