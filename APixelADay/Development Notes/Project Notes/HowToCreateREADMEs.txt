How to create READMEs so you don't forget:

1. (Optional) You don't have to do this, but I like to do it for organization sake, create a folder for all your ReadME's, title it something like "Project Notes".
2. Right click in the Solution Explorer, go to Add, New Item, then select "Text File", click Add.
3. Rename the ReadME to whatever is necessary for your project.
