Styling the navbar is actually quite easy. If you want to change the navbar's color, all you have to do is this, add a "style":

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light border-bottom box-shadow mb-3" style="background-color: #e3f2fd;">

NOTE: Style goes AFTER initial navbar class declaration, not inside of it.
