 7. ADDING MIGRATIONS
**************************

In order to hook up the database to your website, you will need something called a Code-First Migration

To create a CF Migration, you will need to:
1. Go to your upper toolbar where File and Edit are.
2. Find the "Tools" Section.
3. Click on that, go down and select "NuGet Package Manager".
4. From those options, select "Package Manager Console".
5. You've just opened the PMC or "Package Manager Console"!
6. Now, all you need to do is type in these commands:

This command enables migrations for this project, if they haven't been already,
and it will also create a Migrations folder for the project in the Solution Explorer automatically:

enable-migrations

This command adds a migration:
add-migration InitialMigration

Note: The InitialMigration part is its name, so feel free to change that to whatever you like, within reason.
