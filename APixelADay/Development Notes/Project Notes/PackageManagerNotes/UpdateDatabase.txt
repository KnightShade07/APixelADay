		UPDATE-DATABASE
*****************************

"update-database" without the "" is a PMC command that is run
whenever a significant change to the project is made that involves data.

Some examples of this include making a new migration, or adding a new element to a class that
the database uses, like forgetting to add a time datatype to a cooking website.
