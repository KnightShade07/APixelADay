 4.  ASP.NET CORE
**************************

ASP .NET CORE is the framework used for this project, it allows for security features to be added to a project, like roles, and blocking off certain
pages from roles that do not have permission to view those pages.

(Ex: User tries to access page where new pixel art entries are created and added to the gallery,
access is denied because they do not have the role required to perform those actions)
