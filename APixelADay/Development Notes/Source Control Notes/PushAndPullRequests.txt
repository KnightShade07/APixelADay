	PUSH AND PULL REQUESTS
*****************************

Source Control is an integral part of software development, as it covers for many situations a software developer or a web
developer might face, like the power going out, or someone making a mistake, or many others.

Push and Pull Requests are the main methods of how Source Control is used.

A Push is where a developer pushes their code changes up to GitHub. This new code is then reviewed by a supervisor, a coworker, or a peer.

If it is aproved after a review process, then it gets merged into the master branch.

DO NOT ever work in the master branch, instead, create a new branch, and give it an appropriate name for the situation's context.

You can create a new branch by:

1. Clicking on the branch name icon in the lower right section of Visual Studio
2. Selecting "Create a New Branch" from the menu
3. Note: Special Characters are not allowed when creating a new branch.

After you are done with working in that branch:
1. If you are not already there, click the pencil icon to go to the Git Changes
menu in the Solution Explorer when you are done working in that branch.
2. Write a semi-short, but descriptive commit message in the description box.
3. Depending on the situation, you can either stage your commits one by one,
or write one message for them all, and then hit the "Commit All" button.
4. Once that is done, click on the blue up arrow in the right hand corner of the Git Changes section.
5. You've just pushed your commits up to GitHub!

A Pull is where you drag the most recent commits into the master branch.

You can do this by:
1. Making sure you are in the master branch.
2. Clicking the blue down arrow in the Git Changes Window.
3. Your master branch is now up-to-date and you are now free to make another branch
to start working on another feature (or in my case, more documentation! :) )
