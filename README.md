# APixelADay
A website that hosts the pixel art that I create.

This website will use MVC and will eventually have the following working features:
- A Gallery Page to display my pixel art. [COMPLETE]
- Keeps track of what day count it is (This feature is for progression in terms of art, so you'd be able to say "This is what my art looked like on Day 1, and here it is on Day 100!") [COMPLETE]
- Adding and Updating Pixel Art in the gallery. (ADMIN ONLY FEATURE) [COMPLETE]
- Adding Pixel Art should be done through a page only visible to the Admin, image file should be added through the use of a button, said button should
open the computer (prompt them to select an image with the standard open file pop up (Like what Discord does when people want to share an image) so that the admin can select the image that they want. [COMPLETE]
- Deleting Pixel Art in the gallery, if neccessary (ADMIN ONLY FEATURE) [COMPLETE]
- A "Pixel Art of the Day" Page (Selects the most recent piece of pixel art added, and gives it its own details/display page) [COMPLETE]
- Pagination for the Gallery Page (Display only 3 or 4 different pixel arts for a given page at a time). [COMPLETE]
- Support for GIF file type when I learn how to animate in Aseprite eventually. [COMPLETE]

ADVANCED FEATURES (Features that should be attempted/completed once the basic features above have been completed):
- Users should get to log in, like and comment on the art that I make.
- Cross Platform Posting (If a piece of  pixel art gets posted to my website, it will also post to platforms like Instagram and Facebook)
